# This is a primary header for the page
I'm learning how to create markdown headers in .md files on github.

## This is a secondary header
This is a nice way to group content.

###### How small is the tiniest header?
This tiny. ^^^

In contrast, this is a man with a tiny head, not a tiny header. 
``` javascript
let headSize = 100;
while (headSize > 5){
  headSize--;
}
alert("Your head is now tiny.")
```
- [x] Take a selfie.
- [ ] Show selfie to a friend.
- [ ] Rejoice in the knowledge your head is not as tiny as the man in the picture.
